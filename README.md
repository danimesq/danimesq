These are my projects that I turned into organizations.

Yes, there are no people on these organizations other than me myself, unfortunately (people don't join and avoid even their selves nowadays).

TDAH have its dangers and struggles but also have its good side, which give me a huge amount of creativity and brand new projects every year (downside: not finishing a 4-day-long project and already jumping into a brand new idea that popped out)

#### My thoughtful questions about the status of programming and computing in general:
* Why don't we get inspired by git and (urgently, gently) de-duplicate the Web? In 100 years, we'll have more bits than atoms on Earth
* Why having to copy and paste your bio between sites (and leaving leftovers in sites you don't remember often) just to update a number for your birthday age, when they could be centered in a single place where other sites gets the plain text from?
* Ethereum came to question Bitcoin's limitations. But, currently, there are no layer1 projects LEGITIMATELY questioning Ethereum other than BrightID's IDChain. Cardano? Solana? All other "ethereum-killer"s? They are to Ethereum just what BitcoinCash/Litecoin are to Bitcoin.
* The line between a programmer and a "scripter" should be blurred, merged. More than that, I believe Bash/Shell/visual-event-sheet "scripters" (programmers) are way more glorious due to their frugal style/abilities (this "their" is "our" because I'm part of them, us; but for the sake of my mind wellbeing I want not to forget being humble).
* Programming should be known for the visual event-sheets, not bytes/hex/{}/();/notepad brainf&%c
* Linux distros should be developed not with a eyeglass, an idea to fix other distros, coffee and some abilities; they should be developed with love. That's why they should be built 100% in Bash/Shell+JS/HTML/CSS (lets democratize visual event-sheets) and that's why "The year of the Linux in Desktop" did never came.
* Why aren't our screenshot files split in parts, containing HTML/CSS/SVG replacing lots of pixels? This could be also merged/intersected with my idea of file de-duplication.
* Why having a whole new separated video coded to react/duet/reply to another video, when videos could simply be containers building on the top of other? You could deduplicate (and save) a lot of (mega)bytes by just linking a video on the video that wants to insert it. Also, mentioning the previous item: why lots of pixels to have texts/figures on your videos when they could simply be in HTML/CSS/SVG (even the transitions, in CSS)?
* Git does deduplicate texty files such as HTML/CSV/XML/etc. Shouldn't it also deduplicate the audio's wave forms, images and the same as video frames+audio? Git was primarily made for developers (which mostly uses texty files, obviously), but what about LFS and the app/game's assets? Also, git have the potential for uses beyond the dev space. These advanced deduplicing capabilities shouldn't necessarily be added to git, but to a layer2 for it (or in competitors such as Pijul or a layer2 for both git and/or these competitors/alternatives)
* Shouldn't Linux support various types of symlinks or even someone make a filesystem heavily based on deduplication? For example, a single symlink merging bytes from more than one file.
* If you delete a file, rename its containing folder and from the recycle bin you restore it: how will your filesystem/explorer app handle this?

#### My thoughtful questions about the status of tech:
* Emojis represents the humanity's expressions; so why the curation of brand new emojis aren't widely open (through a DAO for example)?
