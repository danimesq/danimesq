Pokémon games based in Brasil:
Pokémon Order & Pokémon Progress
Region: Sambo/Tupy/etc

- Pokémon's own version of Carnival, which are Contests
- return of pokéball seals (can bring back those from BD/SP)
- "brigadeiro" as poké food for Contests (but this will be the first generation with more than 1 signature pokefood)
- return of secret bases, dive and subterrain
- emergency pokemons can be called even having the full 6 pokemon; for example when you need teleport, dive, dig, rock smash, cut, flash, etc (the PC Storage System now have this service)
- Possibility to call Koraidon/Miraidon/Cyclizar as Emergency Pokémon
- cross-trainer pokéballs
- Egg will only hatch but will follow trainer without a pokeball (and without being added to the party) until a pokéball is choosen. They can't anymore heritage pokéball at breeding
- Pokémons, badges (non-fungible) and items (semi-fungible) as NFTs and other numbers as tokens
- Migrate items and badges from all of the previous games
- Through the previous method, trainer can start the journey with a pokeball instead of a starter pokemon (because the starter town & surroundings will have only docile pokemon and once leaving without capturing a poke, a starter will be required - even with a captured pokemon, trainers will still be able to claim a starter)
- return of following pokémon (this time can have up to 7 counting with Emergency Pokémon)
- return of pokéwalker, this time as a phone app integrated with Pokémon Go and PokéballPlus
- both poké amie, refresh, camping and picnic returns
- every pokémon now have their own AI (reactions, feelings, etc) and it will become harder for breeders to use bred Pokémon's stats for advantages
- richer possibilities for the MetaGame/Competitive
- 151 new pokés (and a story about Mew and the Guyana/Amazon), showing the region's biodiversity
- the professor of this region is very creative (as you could expect from brazilians) so rather than just studying, it also makes experiments (and he made a discovery)
- Two big cities instead of one (but Rio as capital with its main symbol - just as Lumiose's tower symbol - and this symbol will be a GYM)
- The first games to mix the effort of various teams of teams (GameFreak, Studio Ilca and maybe Gamlr)
- return of the Safari Zone
- Make these games so groundbreaking as Pokémon BW/PLA/SV; region massiver than Paldea
- (3)DS & GB(A) modes (!), both for graphics/playability but also music; four modes
- Standard/Chibi mode for characters
- Photorealistic/Anime shading modes
- Automatically make realistic avatar through a picture (even anime version)!

- return of poké clothes & dancing

- new gimmick: multi-gimmick
- mega-evolutions for non-fully-evolved pokémons such as Pikachu, Cosmog, Kanto Farfetch'd and Magikarp (!)
