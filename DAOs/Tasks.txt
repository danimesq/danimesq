Consider manually creating the tokens (with burn mechanism and gas optimizations like in ANTv2) of the DAOs, vanity deploying crosschain with same addresses (eg. 0xfl0f in all) and moving from Aragon v1 to v2 importing these tokens

update allocations to reflect new supply and other changes. also update max supply accounting for all networks to deploy including Ethereum. for Plasmmer, mint 50mi and keep other 50mi that may be used for an IPO

Plasmmer will start with an airdrop for GAME and FLOF holders, while keeping an amount to airdrop to other subDAOs that will come later
